# Informedica.GenPres.Lib
Library for calculation of medical orders. This library lets you 
define a medical order and apply constraints. These constraints will
be applied each at a time. Upon applying a constraint, the resulting 
set of options is calculated with resulting constraints.

The current solution file contains a number of projects. These projects 
will move to separate repositories and will be referenced by Nuget. For
ease of developing, these are currently bundled together.

## Documentation 

Currently most of the documentation can be retrieved by running the notebooks with examples
for each project.
